# Optimizing-Resource-Reallocation-for-Dynamic-Requests-in-IoT-based-on-NFV
This provides 3 folders  (one in Java and two in Python) related to different algorithms to evaluate the proposed models

1. Several heuristics alogrithms including PTO(an optimal solution from mixed integer programming technique) , PTH (heuristic algorithm) and PTS (a benchmark solution), written by Java
2. DRL_based algorithm using DQN agent, written by Python
3. Dataset generator, written by Python

There are some packages and tools need to be installed:
1. Python packages: sklearn, tf_agents, tensorflow
2. optimization tools: cplex, gurobi
