# Optimizing-Resource-Reallocation-for-Dynamic-Requests-in-IoT-based-on-NFV

For this project, we publish source code and the runable files to evaluate our proposed model.
It contains 2 parts:

1. The first one is source code in src folder. 
      There are 3 subfolders related to different algorithms to evaluate the proposed models:

      1.1. Several heuristics alogrithms including PTO(an optimal solution from mixed integer programming technique) , PTH (heuristic algorithm) and PTS (a benchmark solution), written by Java
  
      1.2. DRL_based algorithm using DQN agent, written by Python
  
      1.3. Dataset generator, written by Python
     
3. The second one is test-cases with runable file including jar file and python files. We describe step by step how to run those files. Please see it in detail in README.txt
