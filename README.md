# Optimizing-Resource-Reallocation-for-Dynamic-Requests-in-NIoT

This repository contains the source code and executable files for evaluating the proposed solutions. The project is organized into two main sections:

1. Source code
   The src forlder contains the source code, which is futher divided into three subfolders, each corresponding to different algorithls used for model evaluations:
      1.1. Optimal Solutions and Approximation Algorithms, written by Java
  
      1.2. DRL_based Algorithm, implemented using Python
  
      1.3. Dataset Generator, written by Python to generate the neccessary datasets for model evaluation.
     
2. Test Cases and Executable Files
   This section contains the test cases and executable files, which include Java executables and Python scripts. For detailed instructions on how to run these files, please refer to the README.txt file.
